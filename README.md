This tool controls AMI Aptio EFI MMTool, a tool used to edit AMI EFI ROMs.

MMTool lacks an "extract all" feature, which can be useful to compare ROM files.

This tool will extract all modules from the ROM currently opened in MMTool, by controlling MMTool's GUI.

## Instructions

 1. Open MMTool
 2. Open your ROM file
 3. Open the Extract tab
 4. Configure the Extract options
 5. Run extractor.exe (this tool)

A directory will be created in the current directory, named after the ROM file opened in MMTool.
The directory will contain all extracted modules.
